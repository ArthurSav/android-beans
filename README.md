# android-beans

Forked from openbeans.

android-beans is a redistribution of the java.beans package from the Apache Harmony project with additional classes from commons-beanutils and commons-collections to support bean introspection and cloning. The following renaming has occurred:
 * java.beans -> org.mini2Dx.android.beans
 * commons-beanutils -> org.mini2Dx.beanutils
 * commons-collections -> org.mini2Dx.collections

This renaming was done to support the Android environment which does not include java.beans in it's core libraries.
